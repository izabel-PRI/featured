# featured
files for What's New? section

## how to update
### 1. create new thumbnail images
  * images should be 16:9 aspect ratio
  * max 1000px wide to save on file size
  * run through [tinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) compression tool
  * use the same file names and overwrite old images (this way you don't have to update the image URLs in the HTML)

### 2. update link text and URLs
  * in featured.html, link text and URLs for each section are indicated by `<!--UPDATE LINK URLS & TEXT HERE-->`
  * the first URL should also be updated on each section's thumbnail, indicated by `<!--UPDATE IMAGE LINK HERE-->`

### 3. that's all
  * pat yourself on the back for a job well done (also, probably refresh the PRI home page to make sure your changes work correctly!)
